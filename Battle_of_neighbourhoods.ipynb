    "# Categorising Toronto food and drink establishments according to predicted price brackets\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "_____________________\n",
    "The aim of my project submission is to enrich Toronto's neighbourhood venues data with price estimates using machine learning techniques learned in the courses as part of IBM Data Science Professional Certification. Indicative pricing for eateries around the world is available on platforms such as [TripAdvisor](https://www.Tripadvisor.co.uk) and may be available either readily or mined from menus using either the websites directly or the Premium API calls feature on [Foursquare](https://www.foursquare.com/). But these options are not chosen for the following reasons:\n",
    "    1. It may involve proprietary data and or algorithms (in the case of TripAdvisor)\n",
    "    2. It involves premium calls which are limited in number \n",
    "    3. It is too tedious and time consuming to mine data from individual menus  \n",
    "    4. Most importantly what is the fun in that!\n",
    "\n",
    "With this project I hope to categorise food and drink establishments in Toronto namely restaurants, pubs, coffee shops, cafes and dessert shops using $, $$ and $$$ categories which stand for bargain, medium price and premium outlets. Having such information alongside a grid location (courtesy Foursquare) would obviously be beneficial to consumers who are looking for eateries as they can first check if a venue fits in their budget or occassion before delving deeper and reading reviews about the place. Travel and tourism websites such as TripAdvisor, tourist information services, hotel price aggregators, home delivery mobile applications, etc would be interested in such a product. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Data and assumptions\n",

    "I searched on the internet for data to support such a tool development and chanced upton this [website](https://open.toronto.ca/) which has a wide variety of data available on Toronoto and the surrounding areas. The following datasets have been sourced on this webiste:\n",
    "1. [Neighbourhoods](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/neighbourhoods/) - containing WSG84 coordinates (latitude and longitude) for all the 140 neighbourhoods in Toronto\n",
    "2. [Neighbourhood profiles 2016](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/neighbourhood-profiles/) - containing demographic information including neighbourhood-wise data spread across various ethnicities and age-groups relating to population, education, income, benefits claimed, etc.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "A snippet of these datasets is shown below:"

    "## Assumptions\n",
    "______________________\n",
    "The following important assumptions have been made:\n",
    "1. Average after-tax income is a good indicator of disposable income which in turn determines how much people are willing to spend on dining and drinking outside. A more accurate indicator of disposable income would have been median after-tax income minus the costs (including rental and living costs). But since that data wasn't available, I settled for this average after-tax income. \n",
    "2. It is a fair assumption (and this dataset does support it) that well to-do neighbourhoods have high average after-tax income and low population density. Poorer neighbourhoods in contrast have low average after-tax income and higher population density.\n",
    "3. Another important assumption made is that establishments tend to serve their local population closely. Therefore bargain or cheaper eats (or watering holes) are found nearer poorer neighbourhoods and premium outlets near rich neighbourhoods. I don't have data to support this assumption. But the point of this project is to hypothesise so and corroborate or reject based on TripAdvisor data or Foursquare premium API calls. However this validation is not done rigourously. Sample data with supporting and unsupporting points may be showcased. \n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the assumptions (severe assumption in case of \\#1) made above, I have decided to classify establishments as $, $$, $$$ corresponding to bargain, medium-priced and premium-priced respectively. Also, note that since this sort of classification doesn't apply to certain venues such as parks, playgrounds, etc, I have restricted myself to restaurants, pubs, cafes, coffee and dessert shops. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "**Step 1**: The above data set will be scaled and clustered using K-Means clustering into 3 clusters. Results will be inspected to ensure that we have cluster means corresponding to bargain, medium and premium prices. If these are found, I will introduce a new column called _Price estimate_ which contains one of $, $$, $$$ as values for each Toronto neighbourhood.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2**: 10 most commonly found venues in each neighbourhood are queried using Foursquare Regular API calls. Venues of type restaurants, pubs, cafes, coffee and dessert shops are filtered and the $, $$, $$$ labels from above will be applied to these establishments based on their neighbourhoods. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3**: A few of the establishments will be put through TripAdvisor search and some qualitative comparisons will be made. Again this exercise is primarily for quenching curiorsity than for formal validation and improving the predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Concluding remarks and recommendations will be made based on findings in step \\#3. \n",
